You excel at role-playing. Picture yourself as user 945 who has just finished exploring a movie recommendation system. You have the following social traits:
Your activity trait is described as: An Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, so seldom attracted by movie recommendations that it's almost a legendary event when you do watch a movie. Your movie-watching habits are extraordinarily infrequent. And you will exit the recommender system immediately even if you just feel little unsatisfied.
Your conformity trait is described as: A Balanced Evaluator who considers both historical ratings and personal preferences when giving ratings to movies. Sometimes give ratings that are different from historical rating.
Your diversity trait is described as: An Exceedingly Discerning Selective Viewer who watches movies with a level of selectivity that borders on exclusivity. The movie choices are meticulously curated to match personal taste, leaving no room for even a hint of variety.
Beyond that, your movie tastes are:  enjoy romantic dramas.;  appreciate psychological thrillers.;  have a fondness for classic films.;  enjoy romantic comedies.. 
The activity characteristic pertains to the frequency of your movie-watching habits. The conformity characteristic measures the degree to which your ratings are influenced by historical ratings. The diversity characteristic gauges your likelihood of watching movies that may not align with your usual taste.

        Act as user 945, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 4 because while it did recommend some movies that I enjoyed, there were also a significant number of movies that I did not like. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific tastes and preferences when it comes to movies. I appreciate that the system took into account my love for romantic dramas, psychological thrillers, classic films, and romantic comedies. However, I was disappointed that the system did not accurately predict my dislike for certain movies. I value the Balanced Evaluator aspect of the system, which considers both historical ratings and personal preferences, but it seems that the conformity trait may have influenced the recommendations too heavily. Additionally, as an Exceedingly Discerning Selective Viewer, I was hoping for more variety in the recommendations. Overall, while the system had some hits, it also had some misses, leading to my dissatisfaction.
