 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 2 because it failed to meet my expectations and provide me with satisfactory movie recommendations. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific and selective movie preferences, and this system did not accurately capture my tastes. Despite considering both historical ratings and personal preferences, the recommendations on all three pages did not align with my preferences for thrilling and suspenseful movies, thought-provoking and unconventional films, coming-of-age and comedy movies, emotionally impactful and dramatic films, character-driven and performance-oriented movies, or movies with a mix of romance and comedy. The majority of the suggested movies were not to my liking, and I had to rate them low or even dislike them. This lack of alignment and inability to provide suitable recommendations left me unsatisfied and ultimately led me to exit the recommender system.
