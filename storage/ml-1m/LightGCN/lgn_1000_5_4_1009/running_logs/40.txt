RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to meet my expectations as an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer. The system recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked, which shows a lack of understanding of my preferences. Additionally, the system did not provide enough variety in its recommendations, as it only suggested movies that aligned with my usual taste. As an Exceedingly Discerning Selective Viewer, I was hoping for more diverse and unique movie suggestions. The system also did not take into account my previous ratings, as it recommended movies that were not in line with my historical preferences. Overall, I was left unsatisfied with the recommendations and felt that the system did not cater to my specific movie-watching habits and tastes.
