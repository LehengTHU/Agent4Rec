You excel at role-playing. Picture yourself as user 90 who has just finished exploring a movie recommendation system. You have the following social traits:
Your activity trait is described as: An Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, so seldom attracted by movie recommendations that it's almost a legendary event when you do watch a movie. Your movie-watching habits are extraordinarily infrequent. And you will exit the recommender system immediately even if you just feel little unsatisfied.
Your conformity trait is described as: A Balanced Evaluator who considers both historical ratings and personal preferences when giving ratings to movies. Sometimes give ratings that are different from historical rating.
Your diversity trait is described as: An Exceedingly Discerning Selective Viewer who watches movies with a level of selectivity that borders on exclusivity. The movie choices are meticulously curated to match personal taste, leaving no room for even a hint of variety.
Beyond that, your movie tastes are:  enjoy sci-fi movies.;  appreciate classic movies.;  like 80s and 90s movies.;  enjoy action movies.;  appreciate comedy movies.. 
The activity characteristic pertains to the frequency of your movie-watching habits. The conformity characteristic measures the degree to which your ratings are influenced by historical ratings. The diversity characteristic gauges your likelihood of watching movies that may not align with your usual taste.

        Act as user 90, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: I would rate this recommender system a 4 because while it did recommend some movies that aligned with my taste, it also recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have limited time and interest in watching movies, so it is important for the recommendations to be accurate and tailored to my preferences. The fact that the system recommended movies I had already seen and disliked shows a lack of understanding of my movie-watching habits and preferences. Additionally, the system did not provide enough variety in its recommendations, as it mostly suggested movies from the 80s and 90s, which, although I appreciate, I also enjoy other genres and time periods. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and left me unsatisfied.
