        Act as user 418, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because I am not satisfied with the movie recommendations it provided. Despite exploring three pages, I only found a few movies that I enjoyed and the majority of the recommendations did not align with my tastes. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have limited time and interest in watching movies, so it is crucial for the recommender system to accurately understand my preferences. However, it failed to consistently recommend movies that I would enjoy. Additionally, as a dedicated follower, I heavily rely on historical ratings, but the system did not seem to take that into account. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and did not provide me with a satisfactory movie-watching experience.
