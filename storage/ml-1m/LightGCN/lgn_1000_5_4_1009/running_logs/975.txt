RATING: 4
REASON: While the recommender system did recommend some movies that aligned with my taste, it also recommended movies that I had already watched and rated, as well as movies that I disliked. This indicates that the system did not fully understand my preferences and failed to provide me with new and satisfying recommendations. Additionally, the system did not take into account my previous interactions and continued to recommend movies that I had already expressed disinterest in. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and left me unsatisfied.
