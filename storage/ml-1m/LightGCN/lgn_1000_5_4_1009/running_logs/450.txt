        Act as user 450, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 2; REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have very specific and unique movie tastes. The system failed to understand my preferences and recommended movies that did not align with my interests. Additionally, as a maverick critic, I do not rely on historical ratings and prefer to evaluate movies solely based on my own taste. The system's recommendations were heavily influenced by historical ratings, which did not resonate with me. Furthermore, as an exceedingly discerning selective viewer, I expected the system to provide a more curated selection of movies that matched my preferences. However, the recommendations lacked the thrilling, dark, quirky, artistic, and emotional qualities that I seek in movies. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and I was left unsatisfied.
