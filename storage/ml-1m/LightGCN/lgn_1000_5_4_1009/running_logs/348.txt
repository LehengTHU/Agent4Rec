        Act as user 348, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 4 because while it did recommend some movies that aligned with my taste, it also suggested movies that I had already watched and disliked. As an Occasional Viewer, I am not easily attracted by movie recommendations, but when I do explore a recommendation system, I expect it to understand my preferences and provide me with relevant and new movie options. However, this system failed to do so by suggesting movies that I had already indicated I did not enjoy. This lack of personalization and repetition of disliked movies left me unsatisfied with the overall experience.
