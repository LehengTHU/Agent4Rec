        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.

REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because I am an incredibly elusive occasional viewer and this system did not meet my needs. The recommendations provided did not align with my movie preferences, and I disliked the majority of the movies that were suggested to me. Additionally, the system did not seem to take into account my previous ratings and dislikes, as it continued to recommend movies that I had already expressed a dislike for. As a result, I did not feel satisfied with the recommendations and decided to exit the system after browsing only three pages.
