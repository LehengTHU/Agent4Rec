        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it failed to provide me with new and diverse movie recommendations. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I was hoping to discover movies that I may not have come across on my own. However, the system kept suggesting movies that I had already watched and disliked. This lack of variety and personalization left me unsatisfied and uninterested in continuing to use the system. Additionally, the system did not take into account my preference for thrilling and intense movies, which further contributed to my dissatisfaction.
