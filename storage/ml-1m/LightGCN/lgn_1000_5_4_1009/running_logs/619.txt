 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Although I appreciate the system's attempt to recommend movies based on my taste, the recommendations were not aligned with my preferences. I am an exceedingly discerning selective viewer, and the system failed to understand my specific movie preferences. Additionally, the system heavily relies on historical ratings, which limits the diversity of recommendations and does not allow for independent opinions. As an occasional viewer, I was hoping for a more personalized and accurate recommendation system that would cater to my unique tastes. Unfortunately, this system did not meet my expectations.
