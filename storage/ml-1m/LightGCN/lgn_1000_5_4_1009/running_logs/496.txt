        Act as user 496, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3; REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Although I appreciate the diversity of movie recommendations, the system failed to understand my preferences and consistently recommended movies that I had already watched and disliked. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have limited time and interest in watching movies, so it is crucial for the recommender system to provide accurate and tailored recommendations. Additionally, the system did not take into account my affinity for sci-fi, comedy, action, suspenseful thrillers, classic, drama, adventure, mystery, and crime films, which are important aspects of my movie tastes. The lack of personalization and understanding of my preferences greatly affected my satisfaction with the recommender system.
