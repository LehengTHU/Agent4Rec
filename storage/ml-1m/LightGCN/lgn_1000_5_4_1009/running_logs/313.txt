RATING: 2
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 2 because I am extremely unsatisfied with the movie recommendations it provided. Despite my specific movie preferences, the majority of the recommended movies did not align with my taste at all. I only enjoyed a few movies out of the ones I watched, and the rest were disappointing. The system failed to understand my unique and selective taste, and the recommendations felt generic and unappealing. Additionally, the system did not take into account my infrequent movie-watching habits, which made it even more frustrating. Overall, this recommender system did not meet my expectations and did not provide me with satisfying movie recommendations.
