        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 3
REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because it did not meet my expectations. As an Occasional Viewer, I am not easily attracted by movie recommendations, and I am only interested in movies that strictly align with my taste. However, this recommender system failed to take into account my preferences and recommended movies that I ended up disliking. Despite providing ratings for the movies I watched, the system did not seem to adjust its recommendations based on my feedback. Additionally, the system did not consider my dislike for the movies "Being John Malkovich (1999)" and "American Beauty (1999)" that were recommended to me on page 1. As a Balanced Evaluator, I expect the system to consider both historical ratings and personal preferences, but it seemed to prioritize historical ratings over my own taste. Furthermore, as a Niche Explorer, I appreciate exploring different genres occasionally, but the system did not offer enough variety in its recommendations. Overall, I am dissatisfied with this recommender system as it did not cater to my specific movie preferences and did not adapt based on my feedback.
