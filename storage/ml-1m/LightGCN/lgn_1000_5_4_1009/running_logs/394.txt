        Act as user 394, assume you are having a interview, reponse the following question:
        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4; REASON: I appreciate the effort of the recommender system in providing movie recommendations based on my diverse tastes and occasional movie-watching habits. However, I am not satisfied with the system because it recommended movies that I disliked on multiple occasions. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, it is crucial for me to have a high level of satisfaction with the recommendations in order to be motivated to watch a movie. Unfortunately, the system failed to consistently provide me with movies that aligned with my preferences, resulting in a lower rating.
