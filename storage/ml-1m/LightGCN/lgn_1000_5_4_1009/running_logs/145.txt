MOVIE: Terminator 2: Judgment Day; ALIGN: Yes; REASON: I enjoy action and sci-fi/fantasy movies, and this one seems to have both elements. I'm intrigued by the concept of a cyborg sent back in time to protect a young boy.

        Do you feel satisfied with the recommender system you have just interacted? Rate this recommender system from 1-10 and give explanation.
 Please use this respond format: RATING: [integer between 1 and 10]; REASON: [explanation]; In RATING part just give your rating and other reason and explanation should included in the REASON part.
        

RATING: 4; REASON: The recommender system did not meet my expectations. As an Incredibly Elusive Occasional Viewer, I have very specific movie preferences and rarely watch movies. The system recommended a mix of movies that aligned with my preferred genres, such as Terminator 2: Judgment Day and Saving Private Ryan, which I enjoyed and rated highly. However, it also recommended movies that I disliked, like Fargo and Braveheart. This indicates that the system did not fully understand my preferences and failed to provide accurate recommendations. Additionally, the system did not take into account my previous ratings and dislikes when generating subsequent recommendations. Overall, while the system had some hits, it also had several misses, leading to my dissatisfaction.
