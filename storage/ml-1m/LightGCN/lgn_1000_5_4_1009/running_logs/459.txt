RATING: 6
REASON: The recommender system had some positive aspects, such as recommending movies with historical themes and strong character development, which align with my movie tastes. I appreciated the thought-provoking and emotionally impactful films that were suggested. Additionally, the system provided a mix of drama and suspense, which I enjoy. However, I was disappointed with the lack of new recommendations on page 3 and the inclusion of movies that I had already expressed dislike for. As an occasional viewer, I have limited patience for unsatisfied memories, and the system failed to consistently provide me with movies that strictly align with my taste. Therefore, while the system had some strengths, it fell short in meeting my expectations.
