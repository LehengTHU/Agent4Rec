REASON: I rate this recommender system a 3 because I am not satisfied with the movie recommendations it provided. Despite my diverse movie tastes, the system consistently recommended movies that I did not enjoy. While I appreciate the system considering both historical ratings and personal preferences, it seems that the recommendations did not align with my preferences. Additionally, as an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I was hoping for more accurate and tailored recommendations that would entice me to watch more movies. However, the system failed to capture my interest and left me unsatisfied.
