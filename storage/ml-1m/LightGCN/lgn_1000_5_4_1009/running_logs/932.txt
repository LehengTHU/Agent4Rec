RATING: 3
REASON: I am not satisfied with the recommender system. Although I did find a few movies that I enjoyed, the majority of the recommendations did not align with my taste. As an incredibly elusive occasional viewer, I have specific preferences when it comes to movies, and the system failed to consistently recommend movies that I would be interested in. Additionally, as a maverick critic, I do not rely on historical ratings, so the system's reliance on them did not resonate with me. Overall, the system did not meet my expectations and did not provide me with a satisfactory movie-watching experience.
